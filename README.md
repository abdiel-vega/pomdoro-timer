study pomodoro timer with to-do list

basically the timer works in sessions and cycles. 
when the timer in the pomodoro option is over, the timer will set itself to the short break option and count 1 pomodoro session. 
the process repeats again, and after it has completed 2 sessions the timer sets itself to medium break.
then after 4 pomdoro sessions it completes a pomodoro cycle. (so 4 pomodoro sessions = 1 pomodoro cycle)
after that it resets pomdoro sessions and adds a pomodoro cycle.
